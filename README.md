# Hopper

Adds hoppers to Minecraft! Finally, an easy-to-use system for transporting items between chests. It also adds a Block of Redstone, a convenient piston-pushable redstone power source (crafted with 9 redstone dust). These are really cool ideas IMO, I hope Mojang will add them some day!

# Build instructions

You can build the mod with `./gradlew build` and retrieve the result from `./build/libs`.

This is the "old" branch, so when invoking `./gradlew`, JAVA_HOME must be set to a version of Java between 8 and 11. Sorry for the inconvenience.

# Thanks

Thanks to unascribed and TwilightFlower for [doing the toolchain heavy lifting and for providing an example and being cool.](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/tree/3.4.x)

# License

Nominally `LGPL-3.0-or-later` but I literally do not give a shit if you take stuff for learning purposes and ship it in a released mod. Assets are shamelessly ripped from vanilla.
