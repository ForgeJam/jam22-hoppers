# Hopper

Adds hoppers to Minecraft! Finally, an easy-to-use system for transporting items between chests. It also adds a Block of Redstone, a convenient piston-pushable redstone power source (crafted with 9 redstone dust). These are really cool ideas IMO, I hope Mojang will add them some day!

# Build instructions

You can build the mod with `./gradlew build` and retrieve the result from `./build/libs`.

I am putting out Gradle-related fires. If you are having compilation issues, delete `.gradle` then try again [on the `old` branch](https://github.com/quat1024/hoppers/tree/old).

# Thanks

Thanks to unascribed and TwilightFlower for [doing the toolchain heavy lifting and for providing an example and being cool.](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/tree/3.4.x)

# License

Nominally `LGPL-3.0-or-later` but I literally do not give a shit if you take stuff for learning purposes and ship it in a released mod. Assets are shamelessly ripped from vanilla.
