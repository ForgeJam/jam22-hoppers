# Hopper

Adds hoppers to Minecraft! Finally, an easy-to-use system for transporting items between chests. It also adds a Block of Redstone, a convenient piston-pushable redstone power source (crafted with 9 redstone dust). These are really cool ideas IMO, I hope Mojang will add them some day!

# Build instructions

`./gradlew build` should work, then grab the jar out of `/build/libs`.

Nominally `LGPL-3.0-or-later` but I literally do not give a shit if you take stuff for learning purposes and ship it in a released mod. Assets are shamelessly ripped from vanilla.
