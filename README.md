# Hopper

Adds hoppers to Minecraft! Finally, an easy-to-use system for transporting items between chests. It also adds a Block of Redstone, It's a piston-pushable redstone power source, and also acts as a convenient storage block for all that redstone dust you have lying around.

These are really small and simple "Vanilla+" ideas imo. I hope Mojang will consider adding them some day!

Special thanks to unascribed and TwilightFlower.

# Build instructions

You can build the mod with `./gradlew build`, and retrieve the result from `./build/libs`. 

# License

Nominally `LGPL-3.0-or-later` but I literally do not give a shit if you take stuff for learning purposes and ship it in a released mod. Assets shamelessly ripped from vanilla.
